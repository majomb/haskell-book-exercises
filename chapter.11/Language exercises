1. Write a function that capitalizes a word.
import Data.Char
capitalizeWord :: String -> String
capitalizeWord (x : xs) = (toUpper x) : xs
Example output.
Prelude> capitalizeWord "Titter"
"Titter"
Prelude> capitalizeWord "titter"
"Titter"

2. Write a function that capitalizes sentences in a paragraph. Rec-
ognize when a new sentence has begun by checking for periods.
Reuse the capitalizeWord function.

paragraphs :: String -> [String]
paragraphs [] = []
paragraphs xs = take ((length $ takeWhile (/='.') xs) + 2) xs : paragraphs (drop 2 $ dropWhile (/='.') xs)

capitalizeParagraph :: String -> String
capitalizeParagraph xs = foldr (\x acc -> (capitalizeWord x) ++ acc) [] (paragraphs xs)
