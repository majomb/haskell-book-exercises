Determine how many unique inhabitants each type has.
Suggestion: just do the arithmetic unless you want to verify. Writ-
ing them out gets tedious quickly.
1. data Quad =
One
| Two
| Three
| Four
deriving (Eq, Show)
-- how many different forms can this take?
eQuad :: Either Quad Quad
eQuad = 8

2. prodQuad :: (Quad, Quad)
16

3. funcQuad :: Quad -> Quad
256

4. prodTBool :: (Bool, Bool, Bool)
8

5. gTwo :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool
16

6. Hint: 5 digit number
fTwo :: Bool -> Quad -> Quad
65536
