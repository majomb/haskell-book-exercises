1. Given a datatype
data BigSmall = Big Bool | Small Bool deriving (Eq, Show)
What is the cardinality of this datatype? Hint: We already know
Boolâ€™s cardinality. Show your work as demonstrated earlier.

2. Given a datatype
-- needed to have Int8 in scope
import Data.Int
data NumberOrBool =
Numba Int8
| BoolyBool Bool
deriving (Eq, Show)
-- Example use of Numba, parentheses due to
-- syntactic collision between (-) minus and
-- the negate function
let myNumba = Numba (-128)

What is the cardinality of NumberOrBool?
256 + 2
