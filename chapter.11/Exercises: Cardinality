1. data PugType = PugData
cardinality: 1

2. For this one, recall that Bool is also defined with the |:
data Airline = PapuAir | CatapultsR'Us | TakeYourChancesUnited
cardinality: 3

3. Given what we know about Int8, what’s the cardinality of Int16?
cardinality: 65536

4. Use the REPL and maxBound and minBound to examine Int and
Integer. What can you say about the cardinality of those types?
Int: 2*9223372036854775808
Integer: is not bounded

5. Extra credit (impress your friends!): What’s the connection
between the 8 in Int8 and that type’s cardinality of 256?
8 bites
