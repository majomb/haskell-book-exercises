1. Reusing the TooMany typeclass, write an instance of the typeclass
for the type (Int, String). This will require adding a language
pragma named FlexibleInstances 4 if you do not use a newtype
â€” GHC will tell you what to do.
instance TooMany String where
  tooMany s = (length s) > 42

2. Make another TooMany instance for (Int, Int). Sum the values
  together under the assumption this is a count of goats from two
  fields.
instance TooMany (Int, Int) where
  tooMany (x, y) = (x + y) > 42

3. Make another TooMany instance, this time for (Num a, TooMany a)
  => (a, a). This can mean whatever you want, such as summing
  the two numbers together.
  instance (Num a, TooMany a) => TooMany (a, a) where
    tooMany (x , y) = tooMany x && tooMany y
