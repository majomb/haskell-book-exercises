Prelude> let mySqr = [x^2 | x <- [1..5]]
Prelude> let myCube = [y^3 | y <- [1..5]]

1. First write an expression that will make tuples of the outputs of
mySqr and myCube.
[(x,y) | x <- mySqr, y <- myCube]

2. Now alter that expression so that it only uses the x and y values
that are less than 50.

[(x,y) | x <- mySqr, y <- myCube, x < 50, y < 50]

3. Apply another function to that list comprehension to determine
how many tuples inhabit your output list.

length [(x,y) | x <- mySqr, y <- myCube, x < 50, y < 50]
