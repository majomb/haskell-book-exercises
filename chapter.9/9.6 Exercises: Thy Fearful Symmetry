1. Using takeWhile and dropWhile, write a function that takes a string
and returns a list of strings, using spaces to separate the elements
of the string into words, as in the following sample:
*Main> myWords "all i wanna do is have some fun"
["all","i","wanna","do","is","have","some","fun"]

module MyWords where
  myWords :: [Char] -> [[Char]]
  myWords sentence = go sentence [] where
    go [] output = reverse output
    go sentence output = go (drop 1 $ dropWhile (/=' ') sentence) ((takeWhile (/=' ') sentence) : output)

2. Next, write a function that takes a string and returns a list of
strings, using newline separators to break up the string as in the
following (your job is to fill in the undefined function):
poemLines.hs
